                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Thank you for taking the time to visit this website and find out more about this corporate leadership opportunity here at Orkney Islands Council.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">In an islands community, the Council plays a much more involved part in people's everyday lives than can be the case elsewhere. The services that sit within this role's portfolio support and protect our community and maintain and develop vital lifeline infrastructure that collectively touches every aspect of their daily lives: our roads and harbours; waste management; environmental health & trading standards; civil contingencies; planning & development; building standards; ICT; management of the Council's estate plus much more. With strategic responsibility for HR & OD this person is also uniquely positioned to align our workforce strategy to frontline delivery.</p>

                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">It's a hugely diverse and rewarding remit that demands a truly strategic perspective and offers fantastic professional development opportunities. In Orkney, you'll discover a place where you will be closer to outcomes – where you can directly see the impact of what you do every day on the quality of life and opportunity in our community.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Living and working in Orkney really isn't like anywhere else. Resilience and resourcefulness are integral parts of island life. It's a place that presents complex challenges alongside a quality of life that is hard to beat. For the right person, the rewards and job satisfaction are enormous.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">If you are excited about being part of our Council and are eager to make a difference to our community I'd love to have you on our team.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Good luck in your application.</p>

                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-8">Our values - collaborative, accountable, respectful and considerate - aren't just words. They're how we work with communities, with each other, and how we expect our senior team to lead.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-[#1e1e1e] text-xl lg:text-3xl font-medium text-pretty mb-4">Collaborative</h3>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-6">Working across service boundaries is essential. Infrastructure planning informs workforce strategies. Property assets enable service transformation. ICT underpins everything. You'll build partnerships with unions, communities, and external stakeholders whilst fostering collaboration within your diverse directorate.</p>

                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Respect flows through everything - from how infrastructure teams respond to winter emergencies, to how HR handles sensitive employee matters. Island communities depend on these services. Your teams deserve support and development. Respectful leadership creates the foundation for resilient services.</p>

                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-6">Every decision has ripple effects across island communities. Road closures affect school transport. Capital projects impact local businesses. Workforce policies shape lives. Considerate leadership means thinking beyond immediate pressures to long-term sustainability and community impact.</p>

                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Orkney consistently ranks amongst the UK's best places to live, combining outstanding natural landscapes with rich cultural heritage and strong communities.</p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Imagine cycling past 5,000-year-old stone circles on your way to work, or watching puffins nest on sea cliffs during lunch. Here, UNESCO World Heritage sites like <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/skara-brae/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Skara Brae</a> and the <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/ring-of-brodgar-stone-circle-and-henge/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Ring of Brodgar</a> are your neighbours, whilst seals, orcas and the Northern Lights provide regular entertainment.</p>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl mb-8">Orkney offers something increasingly rare: meaningful work in a place where ancient history meets modern innovation, where neighbours become lifelong friends, and where your children can roam safely in landscapes that have inspired generations.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-[#1e1e1e] text-xl lg:text-3xl font-medium text-pretty mb-4">Relocation support</h3>
                    <p class="lg:text-xl">We understand moving to Orkney is a significant decision. We provide interview and relocation expenses in accordance with Council Policy to help you and your family transition smoothly.</p>
