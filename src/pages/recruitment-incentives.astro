                        <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">At Orkney Islands Council we are incredibly lucky to have a hard working and dedicated care workforce – but we need more people to join it!</p>
                        <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">There is a shortage of carers joining the profession across the country and we are struggling to recruit.  This has led to an increased reliance on agency staff – which impacts significantly on our budgets and on the continuity of care for our service users.</p>
                        <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">We’re looking to offer financial incentives which will help encourage more people to join our workforce – making it sustainable for the future and reducing the pressure on you, our existing staff.</p>
                        <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">The ‘Golden Hello’ scheme will be a one-off financial payment of £2000 and will be offered to those taking on social care roles in specific settings, who are either new to care work or returning to care work after time away.</p>
                        <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">The ‘refer a friend’ scheme is an initiative to encourage existing employees of the Council to recommend a career in social care within specific settings to friends, family or former colleagues.  If that person then successfully applies for, takes on a role and remains in the role for three months, then the referrer will receive a £750 payment.</p>
                        <p class="lg:text-xl">We know folk – whether our existing staff or folk interested in the scheme – will have lots of questions and so we’ve pulled together the following frequently asked questions. This page will be added to, so If there’s something which you feel hasn’t been covered, please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:communications@orkney.gov.uk" class="font-medium lg:text-xl text-[#3838fc] hover:animate-pulse">communications@orkney.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Orkney overall has virtually full employment and a significantly higher than average aging population and declining working age population. Orkney Health and Care has higher than average sickness absence levels.  In addition, the use of agency staff within the social care workforce has continued to rise in recent times and we want to reduce the level of agency usage and provide greater consistency of care to everyone who uses our services or lives in one of our establishments.</p>

A recent “Working in Care” survey has highlighted key themes which will be taken forward by the project team.  It was great to see from the survey that lots of staff would like to be part of working groups to help address and offer their advice regarding what we can do to alleviate these challenges.  Working groups will be getting organised and set up in the near future.</p>

                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Induction is hugely important, both in terms of the Council and Service. and we are reviewing our existing content to ensure that, where possible, we make the new inductions as consistent as possible across all areas and that all employees have supported, positive start to their working relationship with the Council.   We will plan inductions out across the year so we are able to have existing staff involved in them and to ensure there is capacity to take the inductions and training forward.</p>
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">A clear training plan will be put in place for the local induction process for all staff to make it consistent across all areas. Discussions will take place prior to recruitment to ensure there is capacity for this.</p>

                                <div class="collapse-content">
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">The Council has over recent years already streamlined pre-employment processes to speed them up wherever possible. The requirements that remain are generally legal requirements and/or requirements of the Care Inspectorate Safer Recruitment approach which the Council is expected to follow.  There is nothing in the pre-employment process or timescales that can be safely cut out that has not already been done.</p>
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Pre-employment check timescales are also largely dependent upon other organisations, applicants or individuals processing them, for example Disclosure Certificates, Medical Pre-Employment Health Checks, and Employment References, to name some.</p>
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">To help, Recruiting Managers will be carrying out as much of the pre-employment checks as possible at interview, i.e. evidence of right to work in the UK, qualifications, driving licence and professional registration (where appropriate) in line with the current Council Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure.  It can also be useful and often lead to faster turnaround times, when the successful candidate helps to ensure they complete their part of these processes as quickly as they can, such as filling in forms, and notifying their referees to look out for a reference request as they will be guided to do.  Recruiting Managers will be maintaining contact with successful applicants during the pre-employment process to look to remind and support them to complete these as quickly as possible.</p>

                                <div class="collapse-content">
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">The survey has been analysed and the project team will be reviewing the findings of this in more detail and prioritising the key themes that have been raised.   Staff will be contacted about this in due course with action points that OHAC are taking forward plus there will be further opportunity for involvement through focus groups.</p>
                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">Over and above that there has been other work already carried out to help increase the pool of potential candidates who can apply for posts.  For example in Care at Home posts driving is no longer an essential criteria for day/evening posts.  This change has been made as staff, who work in the service, have been highlighting that they are aware of people who would love to work in care at home but don’t drive.</p>

Our agency colleagues have left their families and their homes in mainland UK to come to Orkney to work and help us deliver our services and we could not have continued to deliver services in the way we have without them.   However we need to build a larger contracted workforce that delivers greater consistency of service provision.  It is not anticipated that we will see any immediate differences in our agency workforce but as the project progresses the services will review the position.  We want to reassure our agency colleagues that we will have ongoing conversations with them at each step of the way.</p>

                                <p class="lg:text-xl mb-4">We acknowledge that the Council faces a number of different challenges relating to recruitment and retention of staff, including the availability and costs of accommodation, which is largely out with the control of the Council as an employer.   However as part of the Council’s Our People Our Plan work, a working group has been looking at steps that could be taken to try to assist with the accommodation challenges and recommendations are being made to the Council.</p>

It was explained that the good work staff carry out and their value base and behaviours make them ambassadors for their respective services;  that their work speaks for them;  the reasons that staff have stated they would recommend someone to work for the Council and what is important to them all demonstrates an ambassador approach.</p>
